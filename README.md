 # Project Description

This project implements a regression-based machine learning pipeline grounded in statistical modeling and quantitative evaluation.

# 🔬 Methodology
	•	Data preprocessing and feature selection
	•	Model training using optimization based on Mean Squared Error (MSE)

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE) – objective function for training
	•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – magnitude of prediction error
	•	Coefficient of Determination (R²) – goodness of fit and variance explanation

# 📈 Analysis

Model performance is analyzed through metric-driven comparisons to evaluate prediction accuracy, generalization capability, and error behavior. Emphasis is placed on reproducibility, analytical rigor, and empirical interpretation of results.
